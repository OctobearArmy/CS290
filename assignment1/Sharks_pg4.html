       <p> Named after its recognizable tiger stripes, the tiger shark is another <br>
        well known shark that is an apex predator like the great white, though not <br>
        quite measuring up to the same size. Average tiger sharks measure between 11-14 feet, <br>
        and they weigh anywhere from 500-1500 lbs. Like most sharks, female tiger sharks <br>
        outsize the males, with the largest recorded female coming in at 16 feet long <br>
        and weighing over 2000 lbs. Like the great white, orca pods are the only known <br>
        predator to tiger sharks and even so it is not a common occurrence. Tiger sharks <br>
        are often referred to as the garbage cans of the sea because they are not picky about<br>
        what they eat, and because of the shape and serrations of their teeth they can <br>
        eat harder prey such as sea turtles without encountering too much difficulty <br>
        with the exterior shell. Tiger sharks are also one of the few sharks who will <br>
        actually eat a human as opposed to just biting them, making them more dangerous <br>
        in the case of an attack. Even so, attacks from tiger sharks are rare and the <br>
        sharks are often safely worked with by scientists. The females tend to be more <br>
        curious and friendly than the males, and tiger sharks are often the sharks that <br>
        are around for tourist adventures such as shark cage diving or diving with sharks. <br>
        Part of the reason for this is location, tiger sharks tend to stay near the coast <br>
        in tropical waters, preferring warmth and following the warm currents during <br>
        the colder months. While tiger sharks do not necessarily live in packs, there has <br>
        been evidence of them working together in certain situations, such as an island <br>
        off the coast of Australia having so many tiger sharks that they actually top the <br>
        food chain over great whites in the area, despite the natural tendency and size <br>
        advantage going to the great white. For the most part though, they are somewhat <br>
        solitary creatures despite their numbers. While the tiger shark is not currently <br>
        facing a population crisis, they are considered near threatened globally, and it <br>
        is important that they their numbers stay stable or even increase for the overall <br>
        balance of the oceanâ€™s homeostasis. </p>
