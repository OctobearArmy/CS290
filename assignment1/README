In my website I want to provide people with information about sharks.
Title: Sharks
picture
Header: Introduction
I would have an introductary paragraph or two talking about how great sharks are
Header:Common types of sharks
a list of common types of sharks that when clicked on open up to a picture of the shark and a paragraph of information about the chosen shark or possibly just a link to the wikapedia pages. 
Header: Important Shark Terminology
I would have a descriptive list of important shark terminology
Header:Sharks are our Friends
picture/video
Below that there would be another section with a paragraph about how sharks are important to our ocean's ecosystem 
then after that there would be a ranked list of the greatest dangers to sharks. 
I would also include a table that has the most critically endangered sharks their cause for endangerment and possibly their habitats as well.
possibly another video/picture
