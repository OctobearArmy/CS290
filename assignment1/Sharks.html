        <p><strong>Sharks are one of a kind in more than one way!</strong> Although they are fish, many sharks give birth to <br>
        live young. This separates them from other fish who lay eggs to reproduce. Some species of sharks <br>
        have even more unique reproductive practices, such as sand tiger sharks having two wombs to ensure <br>
        that two pups survive the pregnancy. Female sharks across the board are considered stronger and tougher <br>
        than the males, partially because of how aggressive most sharks are when they breed. In order to survive, <br>
        the female sharks must endure bites and other aggressive behavior from the males. But don’t worry! <br>
        Most sharks take a long nap afterwards, upwards of 12 hours.</p>
        <p><br>Sharks come in all shapes and sizes, and eat all sorts of food. Some sharks are huge and eat tiny food, <br>
        like whale sharks and basking sharks. Despite being the largest sharks, they eat only small prey like krill. <br>
        Other sharks like great whites prefer to eat bigger prey like seals or other smaller sharks and fish. <br>
        Still other sharks like the tiger shark are not picky with what they eat, earning them the nickname of  <br>
        the trash can of the sea. They have even adapted to easily devour sea turtles despite their protective shell. <br>
        Bull sharks are another well known hungry shark, they oftentimes will work their way upstream into the freshwater <br>
        to hunt for easy food. </p>

        <p>As vast as the ocean is, it takes a <em>lot</em> of creatures to keep everything in balance.<br>
        One such creature is the shark, with species as varied as they are unique. There are big sharks and <br>
        small sharks, and sharks in the deep water and sharks in the shallows. There are sharks everywhere in <br>
        between. And without these sharks the ecosystem would be out of whack, and in some place so would the <br>
        economy! It is important that we try and protect these sharks from mass culling from fishermen’s nets, <br>
        shark finning practices, and fear induced shark hunting practices. Statistically, humans kill far more <br>
        sharks than shark have ever killed humans.</p>
