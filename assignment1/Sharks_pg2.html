       <p> When most people think of sharks the image that comes to mind is the great white shark. <br>
        Hollywood is part of the reason for this, Jaws itself was modeled after a great white shark. <br>
        While the fear may have some truth behind it, since great whites are responsible for the <br>
        largest number of fatal shark attacks globally, the occurrence is still incredibly rare, <br>
        with numbers coming in at less than ten around the world annually. These fish are the top <br>
        dogs of the ocean in most cases, although they do fall victim to packs of hungry Orcas who <br>
        enjoy the liver of a great white as a fatty snack. Great whites can be found in the surface <br>
        waters of all oceans, temperate and tropical, and they usually hang out near the coast because <br>
        their favorite snack, seals, can be found there. They migrate often to breed or to feed, <br>
        and because of this combined with their size, keeping a great white in an aquarium is not <br>
        a feasible idea even though it has been tried in the past. These sharks are huge! The average <br>
        males grow to be 12 feet on average, while the females generally closer to the 15 or 16 <br>
        foot mark. The largest recorded great white was a female who measured just over 19 feet and <br>
        tipped the scales at over 4,000 lbs! Although these are some of the biggest sharks known to <br>
        man, they are not invulnerable. In fact, great white sharks are classified as vulnerable in <br>
        population globally, and critically endangered in Europe. Some countries like Australia have <br>
        specific conservation laws written to help the survival and rebuilding of the great white <br>
        shark population. </p>
