Websites with aspects I like/ dislike:
1. Moodle
 -https://moodle.org/ I like how moodle is organized and makes it very easy for the student to know when assignments are due. However I think it could be improved by making it easier for instructors to access and change grades in the system.
2. Archive of Our Own
 -https://archiveofourown.org/ I like how the searching/filter system is set up to give you multiple options for filtering in each category unlike a lot of other sites that serve the same function. In my opinion the site could be improved if they made the filter consistent every time instead of taking you to a whole new page or popping out to the right depending on how you search initially. The options between the two aren't even consistent. 
3. Nexus mods and community
 -https://www.nexusmods.com/ This site is awesome! It has a great system for filtering mods. It has a way to keep track of downloaded mods/ when they update. It does tend to load slowly sometimes especially if it has a video add playing. Theres also a lot to sort through sometimes. I would maybe try to add more specific tags as well as multiple tag searching.
4.Youtube
 -https://www.youtube.com/ Add placement is inconvienient and inconsistant at times. The algorithm is sometimes very much a scam. I would try to make adds more out of the way and less annoying and if that were impossible I would at least remove adds from medical videos.
5. w3schools
 - https://www.w3schools.com/ Has everything layed out neatly and goes a good job going through the steps of a specific element. I would change how condensed some of the walls of text are. maybe it's just my ADHD but it can bee difficult to absorb suck big chunks of text at a time.
