In my website the main purpose is that I want to provide people with information about sharks.
Title: Sharks (if possible I want big blocky letters like in JAWS)
My format should hopefully be such that it's accessible to both large and small screens.
I will add a style section that will center and format the whole body so that everything is centered better
I will also pick a category (probably paragraphs) to highlight is some way.
I'll probably end up putting a border in or something.
I might also add some fancy colors to words such as headings or important parts in the text.
Header: Sharks
Sidebar containing links to all the sections
picture: I want the first image on the page to be big and grand and centered perfectly under the heading but I don't want it to be too big on mobile.
I would have an introductary paragraph or two talking about how great sharks are
Header:Common types of sharks
a scrollable list of common types of sharks that when clicked on open up to a picture of the shark and a paragraph of information about the chosen shark on those pages there will be a link to the wikapedia page of that shark labled "more Information". I will also attempt to beautify those pages (background picture etc)
Header: Important Shark Terminology
I would have a descriptive list of important shark terminology
I would like to add an accordian that holds information on the life cycle of sharks or something.
I would use collapsible containers for each term so that it was a little like a flash card
Header:Sharks are our Friends
picture/video
Below that there would be another section with a paragraph about how sharks are important to our ocean's ecosystem 
then after that there would be a ranked list of the greatest dangers to sharks. 
I would also include a table that has the most critically endangered sharks their cause for endangerment and possibly their habitats as well.
possibly another video/picture
At the end I will ask the user to take a quiz on what they learned and it will take them to a new page that holds a drag and drop style quiz.
the dragdrop quix checks for correct answers and gives you a score. additionally it makes sure you can only submit 1 of each answer into the three boxes

the drag drop quiz has a next question button that takes you to a new page with three textbox questions that uses a dictionary api to spellcheck responses

Now, go re-review each of the sites you picked at the start of the term, reviewing them now with your new knowledge of web development might make you notice more of some kinds of problems and make some of the problems less of a problem.  Be sure to include any thoughts you have on why your thoughts or opinions might have changed.
assignment 1:
A huge issue was the lack of centering. It made it hard to look at the paragraphs especially.
assignment 2:
still no centering and I wish I could add divs to divide up the page better because that is a problem I can't ignore
assignment 3:
no real problems but the lack of interactable things made it more boring. I liked being able to make thing shift with a click. making user interaction more fun. divs would be helpful.
assignment 4:
Knowing what I know now I would have done a lot more of my javascript in jqery. I enjoyed it much more once I started using it.
assignment 5:
knowing what I know now about serverside (a lot more) I would have made a way to add new flashcards or something. that said. the only thing i had a problem with for my project is that I didn't make each flashcard have their own div to put the defenition in.

Lastly, go review each of your own projects from the point of view of the aspects that you liked and disliked at the start of the term.
assignment 1:
obviously not having css made everything look really bland. I disliked not being able to center everything and not having color 
assignment 2:
I'm glad for the addition of css. I hate boring looking websites. Massive aesthetic improvement!
assignment 3:
I liked being able to make thing shift with a click. making user interaction more fun and interesting. 
assignment 4:
I loved the cool things that javascript added. Javascript is important. Be it site searches or literally any other webapp that isn't just a simple informational website
assignment 5:
Serverside is super useful for saving suggestions in input boxes, secure sign ins etc. I didn't realize how useful it could be.
