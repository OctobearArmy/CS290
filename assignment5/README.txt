In my website the main purpose is that I want to provide people with information about sharks.
Title: Sharks (if possible I want big blocky letters like in JAWS)
My format should hopefully be such that it's accessible to both large and small screens.
I will add a style section that will center and format the whole body so that everything is centered better
I will also pick a category (probably paragraphs) to highlight is some way.
I'll probably end up putting a border in or something.
I might also add some fancy colors to words such as headings or important parts in the text.
Header: Sharks
Sidebar containing links to all the sections
picture: I want the first image on the page to be big and grand and centered perfectly under the heading but I don't want it to be too big on mobile.
I would have an introductary paragraph or two talking about how great sharks are
Header:Common types of sharks
a scrollable list of common types of sharks that when clicked on open up to a picture of the shark and a paragraph of information about the chosen shark on those pages there will be a link to the wikapedia page of that shark labled "more Information". I will also attempt to beautify those pages (background picture etc)
Header: Important Shark Terminology
I would have a descriptive list of important shark terminology
I would like to add an accordian that holds information on the life cycle of sharks or something.
I would use collapsible containers for each term so that it was a little like a flash card
Header:Sharks are our Friends
picture/video
Below that there would be another section with a paragraph about how sharks are important to our ocean's ecosystem 
then after that there would be a ranked list of the greatest dangers to sharks. 
I would also include a table that has the most critically endangered sharks their cause for endangerment and possibly their habitats as well.
possibly another video/picture
At the end I will ask the user to take a quiz on what they learned and it will take them to a new page that holds a drag and drop style quiz.
at the end of the quiz I will ask them to input their names and will attempt to add their name and score to a list. Either that or I'll have a textbox question added to the bottom

SIDE NOTE: is part tree of this assignment met by my using node with express in my server code?
