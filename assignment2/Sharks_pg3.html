       <p> If any shark is to earn its reputation for being a vicious killing machine, <br>
        the bull shark would be at the top of the list. While it is much smaller than <br>
        some sharks (the largest recorded specimen was a female about 8 feet long and <br>
        over 800 lbs, but average females usually measure 8 feet and 300 lbs.), the level <br>
        of aggression in the bull shark is high, and their behavior is considered unpredictable <br>
        by many scientists. Their aggressive nature and stocky build is where the bull <br>
        shark gets its name, but it is also known by many other local names such as the <br>
        zambi shark or the river shark. Bull sharks are especially unique and potentially <br>
        more dangerous because of their adaptability. While most other sharks are bound <br>
        to the salinated waters of the seas, bull sharks are fully capable of surviving far <br>
        inland in fresh water habitats such as rivers and lakes. They also tend to prefer <br>
        murky waters, making it hard to tell if one is around until it is too late. Despite this <br>
        seeming advantage to survival, bull sharks are still considered to have a population <br>
        that is threatened globally, and they fall under the vulnerable classification <br>
        which is the last step before becoming endangered. It is important to protect what <br>
        remains of the bull shark population and try to build it back to stability.</p>
