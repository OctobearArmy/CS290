  <p class="para"><strong> &emsp; Sharks are one of a kind in more than one way!</strong> Although they are fish, many sharks give birth to 
    live young. This separates them from other fish who lay eggs to reproduce. Some species of sharks 
    have even more unique reproductive practices, such as sand tiger sharks having two wombs to ensure 
    that two pups survive the pregnancy. Female sharks across the board are considered stronger and tougher 
    than the males, partially because of how aggressive most sharks are when they breed. In order to survive, 
    the female sharks must endure bites and other aggressive behavior from the males. But don’t worry! 
    Most sharks take a long nap afterwards, upwards of 12 hours.
    <br> &emsp; Sharks come in all shapes and sizes, and eat all sorts of food. Some sharks are huge and eat tiny food, 
    like whale sharks and basking sharks. Despite being the largest sharks, they eat only small prey like krill. 
    Other sharks like great whites prefer to eat bigger prey like seals or other smaller sharks and fish. 
    Still other sharks like the tiger shark are not picky with what they eat, earning them the nickname of  
    the trash can of the sea. They have even adapted to easily devour sea turtles despite their protective shell. 
    Bull sharks are another well known hungry shark, they oftentimes will work their way upstream into the freshwater 
    to hunt for easy food. </p>

            As vast as the ocean is, it takes a <em>lot</em> of creatures to keep everything in balance. 
        One such creature is the shark, with species as varied as they are unique. There are big sharks and 
        small sharks, and sharks in the deep water and sharks in the shallows. There are sharks everywhere in 
        between. And without these sharks the ecosystem would be out of whack, and in some place so would the 
        economy! It is important that we try and protect these sharks from mass culling from fishermen’s nets, 
        shark finning practices, and fear induced shark hunting practices. Statistically, humans kill far more 
        sharks than shark have ever killed humans.</p>
